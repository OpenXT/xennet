Building the XenNet Package
===========================

First you'll need a device driver build environment for Windows 10. Happily
Microsoft has made this easy with the introduction of the 'EWDK'. This is an
ISO containing all the build environment you need.

The package should support building with the following EWDKs:

- EWDK for Windows 10, version 1809 with Visual Studio Build Tools 15.8.9

Once you have downloaded the ISO, open it and you should see a file called:

LaunchBuildEnv.cmd

Run this and it should give you a build environment command prompt. From
within this shell navigate to the root of your checked out repository
and run:

powershell ./build.ps1

This will then prompt you for whether you want a 'free' (non-debug) or a
'checked' (debug) build and then proceed to build all x86 and x64 drivers.

NOTE: Because the EWDKs do not contain the 'dpinst' re-distributable driver
installer utility, this will not be included in the built driver package
by default. However, if you set the environment variable DPINST_REDIST to
point to a directory with x86 and x64 sub-directories containing 32- and
64-bit dpinst.exe binaries (respectively) then these will be copied into
the built packages, making installation more convenient.
